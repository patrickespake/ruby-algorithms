Ruby Algorithms
===============

Some Algorithms in Ruby and Strategies of Implementations.

## Fundamentals

### Big O
1. [Stack space in recursive calls counts as O(n) space.](fundamentals/big_o/1_time_and_space/README.md)

## Algorithms

1. [Times that you can divide by 2](algorithms/times_that_you_can_divide_by_2/README.md)
2. [Roman to integer](algorithms/roman_to_integer/README.md)
